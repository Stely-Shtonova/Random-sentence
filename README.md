# Random-Sentence Program
*********************
This program is just for fun!

This is a program that randomly generates sentences. The computer automaticaly chooses:

- name
- city
- adverb
- verb
- adjective
- noun
- place

In the end one ore more random sentences are displayed on the screen.
The game's logic is based on a function that prints the sentences and lists that are used to store the data that the computer can choose from using the random module.
